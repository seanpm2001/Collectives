Collectives are a distinct administrative unit type, being a meta type, meaning it can be applied to any administrative unit.

Collectives have the Bucket `ü™£Ô∏è` Emoji assigned to them.

More information can be found [:octocat: `in my profile repository`](https://github.com/seanpm2001/seanpm2001/) that information should be ported here in the future.
